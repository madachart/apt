    „This place is stunning! Absolutely beautiful apartment inside, plus beautiful views from the living areas too! We
    did stay between Christmas and New Year so the immediate area across the road was all decorated and there was lots
    of action around with the Christmas markets. It’s a great area for transport connections and within walking distance
    to pretty much everything you want to see. Great ammenities near by too. Our family loved staying here!! I would
    highly recommend this place!!" <strong>Natalie S., Australia </strong>

    <p> "This apartment was my best experience so far. Only one word to describe the location: perfect!
        Within 100 meters, we have metro (which we didn't use because the apartment is at the center of everything) and
        tram lines, supermarkets, restaurants and everything that is needed. The view is fantastic, for Buda and the
        Budapest Eye. Despite being in the center of the animation, you don’t hear anything, because of the double
        windows! And then the décor… exquisite. Great level and great taste. The building is also lovely. The apartment
        has everything you need, including a modern coffee machine. And with coffees! In short, it was a wonderful
        experience. My 13 year old son summed it up perfectly, when he said he liked to live in this apartment forever!
        Congratulations!” <strong>Luis Miguel, Lisbon, Portugal</strong>

    <p></p> „It is a very lovely house for anyone to stay in Budapest. Located in the very heart of Budapest, and the
    view from the living room is amazing. You can see the Budapest Eye with gorgeous sunset every evening. And inside
    the house, there's all you need. if you are not short on budget, and you want to live very comfortable, then this is
    the right place for you.” <strong>TC Lee, Hong Kong</strong>

    <p></p> „Great location! This place was amazingly located in the center of Budapest. Near to everything that I
    needed and quick walking distance to all downtown attractions. My only thing that I brought up to the property
    manager was the security system sensor light in the bedroom would activate every time I made a small move while in
    bed. Somewhat bothersome but the location of this apartment compensated for anything else. Internet was great and
    fast, and cable tv had a great option of English channels as well. thank you!” <strong>Javier and family, Michigan,

    design and old art deco. We can recommend this accomodation to everyone and take it again by our next travel to
    Budapest. You will feel good there for sure." <strong>Joja, Germany</strong>

    <p></p> „ I stayed in this apartment twice now, and I will continue to come back. As a Hungarian who visits Budapest
    from abroad I can honestly say this apartment is everything! Fast wifi, very centeal, yet not too loud, clean,
    modern, spaceous. Its better in real life than on the pictures. The host is very attentive, great with
    communication, flexible with check in and check out times. As I said, best I could find so far." <strong>Enikő
